[Verse]

Em                                 Dsus/F#     G   G2
From the highest of heights to the depths of the sea
Am              Am7/G             F
Creation's revealing Your majesty
Em                              Dsus/F#      G      G2
From the colours of fall to the fragrance of spring
Am                           Am7/G           F
Every creature unique in the song that it sings
C2
All exclaiming


[Chorus]

G                    Dsus
Indescribable, uncontainable,
C2                                              Em
You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by name.
                   C2
You are amazing God
G  G2           Dsus
All powerful, untameable,
C2                                             Em
Awestruck we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim
                 C2
You are amazing God


[Verse]

Em                                Dsus/F#         G   G2
Who has told every lightning bolt where it should go
Am                    Am7/G                 F
Or seen heavenly storehouses laden with snow
Em                              Dsus/F#         G     G2
Who imagined the sun and gives source to its light
Am                        Am7/G                 F
Yet conceals it to bring us the coolness of night
              C2 
None can fathom


[Chorus]

G                    Dsus
Indescribable, uncontainable,
C2                                                    Em
You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by name.
                         C2
You are amazing God
G     G2             Dsus
All powerful, untameable,
C2                                             Em
Awestruck we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim
                  C2
You are amazing God

G                    Dsus
Incomparable, unchangeable
C2                                                  Em
You see the depths of my heart and You love me the same
                  C2
You are amazing God
                  C2
You are amazing God
