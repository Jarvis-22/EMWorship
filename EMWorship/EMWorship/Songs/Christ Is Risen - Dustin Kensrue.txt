Oh! Look at the tree
A                D
Oh! See where He died to save me

A                D
All in Adam will die
A                    D
Oh! In Christ we can all be alive


A            D                            A
 Hallelujah!  The stone has been rolled away
A            D                            A     D
 Hallelujah!  Jesus walked away from the grave


A                      D
Oh! Death where's your sting?
A                D
Oh! How you have tasted defeat?

A                            D
The grave could not hold Him down
A            D
Oh! In Him   true life is found

Oh the blood shed,   Then the last breath
A             D
Resurrection   Salvation


A                D
Christ is risen  Christ is Risen!
A                D
Christ is risen  Christ is Risen!

And my soul knows  Sweet salvation
A                D
Christ is risen  Christ is Risen!
