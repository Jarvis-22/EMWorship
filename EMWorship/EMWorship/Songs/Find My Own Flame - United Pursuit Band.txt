                 C                       F
I don't want to ride on somebody else's passion
                 C                       F
I don't want to find that I'm just dry bones
             C                    F
I want to burn with unquenchable fire
             C                    F
Deep down inside see it coming alive

                     C    F
Help me find my own flame
                     C    F
Help me find my own fire
                     C    F
I want the real thing
                     C    F
I want Your burning desire

F                                 
Do what only You can do
C
In my heart tonight,

                     C
There's no better time
                     F
There's no better time
                    C/E
There's no better time
                     Dm
There's no better time
