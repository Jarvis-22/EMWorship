[Verse 1]

         D#           B        F G#m7           (No Bass)
You were God from the outset,
     D#m        B      F# G#m
powerful and creative 
        B 
You had sought us here before
    D#m            C#            B
You called all the stars and the earth to existence

        D#           B     F G#m7               (Add Bass)
You are God, You are Holy
      D#m      B      F# G#m            
History’s Your story
        B              D#m          C#         B
You who was and is and forever will be, God we live for Your glory


[Chorus]

           F#      C#                  D#m
So we will run altogether with hearts aflame
       B                  F# 
Like a fire that can’t be tamed 
    G#m7     D#m           B
Our God all glory to Your name, Jesus

You are God You are freedom,

You’re alive now within us 
        B  
You who sought us here before 
    D#m           C#           B
You conquered the grave You’re living on Your promise

Our desire that You be praised
