         G                        C         
I'm so forgetful, but You always remind me
Em              G/B               C
You're the only one who brings me peace
You're the only one who brings me peace

        D   G/B   C 
So I come, Lord I come 
I come, Lord I come

                     G          
To tell you I love you
                     C         
To tell you I need you
                    Em                 G/B              C
To tell you there's no better place for me than in your arms
                G
To tell you I'm sorry
                C 
For running in circles
               Em           G/B                C 
For placing my focus on the waves, not on your face

Em              G/B               C
You're the only one who brings me peace
You're the only one who brings me peace
