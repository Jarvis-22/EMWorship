[Chorus 1]

      D
The enemy has been defeated
      E
And death couldn’t hold You down
                 D
We’re gonna lift our voice in victory
                  E
We’re gonna make Your praises loud
(repeat)


[Chorus 2]

D
Shout unto God with a voice of triumph
E
Shout unto God with a voice of praise
D
Shout unto God with a voice of triumph
E
We lift your name up, we lift Your name up
(repeat)
