[Verse 1]

            Bm
I have this hope
                   D 
As an anchor for my soul
             A 
Through every storm
              G  
I will hold to You
             Bm
With endless love
                      D 
All my fear is swept away
        A 
In everything
               Bm 
I will trust in You


[Chorus]

         G                         D
There is hope in the promise of the cross
         Em            Bm                A
You gave everything to save the world you love
         G                      Bm
And this hope is an anchor for my soul
            A
Our God will stand
    G
Unshakeable
