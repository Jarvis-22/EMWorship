[Chorus]

    G
For We trust in our God,
    C
And through his unfailing love,
                  Em
We will not be shaken
                  Em
We will not be shaken
                  C
We will not be shaken.


[Verse]

           G
Though the battle rages,

We will stand in the fight.
           C
Though the armies rise up against

Us on all sides,
                  Em
We will not be shaken
                  Em
We will not be shaken
                  C
We will not be shaken.


[(3x)Bridge] 

          Am
For in the hour of our
C          G
Darkest day, we will not tremble,
         D
we won't be afraid.
                                   Am                      C
Hope is rising like the light of
    G
Dawn. Our God is for us, he has
D
Overcome!
