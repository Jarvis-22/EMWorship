[Verse]

G
We bow our hearts
D/F#
We bend our knees
C                         G
Oh Spirit come make us humble
G
We turn our eyes
D/F#
From evil things
C
Oh Lord we cast down our idols


[Chorus]

                  G
So give us clean hands
                  D
and give us pure hearts
       Em           D         C
Let us not lift our souls to another
                  G
Oh give us clean hands
                  D
and give us pure hearts
        Em          D         C
Let us not lift our souls to another
                   G
Oh God let this be
                   D
a generation that seeks
                Em       D     C
Who seeks Your face, Oh God of Jacob
                 G
Oh God let us be
                   D
a generation that seeks
                Em       D     C
Who seeks Your face, Oh God of Jacob
