[Verse 1]

E
Come, Thou Fount of every blessing
C#m7
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace
A
Streams of mercy, never ceasing
E
Call for songs of loudest praise
E
Teach me some melodious sonnet
C#m7
Sung by flaming tongues above
A
Praise the mount, I'm fixed upon it
E
Mount of God?s unchanging love

(Same chords throughout)


[Verse 2] (Drums in)

Here I raise my Ebenezer
Hither by Thy help I've come
And I hope by Thy good pleasure 
Safely to arrive at home 
Jesus sought me when a stranger 
Wandering from the fold of God 
He, to rescue me from danger 
Interposed His precious blood


[Instrumental] 

E C#m7 A E


[Verse 3]

O to grace how great a debtor 
Daily I'm constrained to be 
Let Thy grace now, like a fetter 
Bind my wandering heart to Thee 
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it 
Prone to leave the God I love 
Here's my heart, O take and seal it 
Seal it for Thy courts above


[Verse 1 again]

E
Come, Thou Fount of every blessing
C#m7
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace
A
Streams of mercy, never ceasing
E
Call for songs of loudest praise
E
Teach me some melodious sonnet
C#m7
Sung by flaming tongues above
A
Praise the mount, I'm fixed upon it
E
Mount of God?s unchanging love
