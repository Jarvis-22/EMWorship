[Verse 1]
C
All that I am Lord
F
Will follow you all of my days
C
No looking back
F
I've left behind my former ways


[Verse 2]
C
No hesitation
F
I've made my choice I won't delay
C
I'm not afraid
F
I give my all to go your way


[Pre-Chorus]
Am               G
So fill my cup to overflow
            F
Holy Spirit, pour out new wine upon my thirsty soul


[Chorus]
C
Cause there is none but you
F
And my life is yours
Am
And I'm drawing near 
C               G
With out stretched arms
         Dm
My hearts abandoned 
     F
As I surrender


[Bridge]
C
All for you, the highest praise, be lifted up and glorified
F
All for you, my soul will sing, be exalted in my life
Am
All for you and no one else
G                    F
Your glory goes beyond all fame
