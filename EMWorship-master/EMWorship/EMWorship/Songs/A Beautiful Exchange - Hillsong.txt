[Intro]

Bm A G D


[Verse 1]

           Bm
You were near
                 D/F#
Though I was distant
    G      
Disillusioned I was
D
Lost and insecure
              Bm
Still mercy fought
        D/F#
For my attention
                            G         
You were waiting at the door
D
Then I let you in


[Verse 2]

Trading your life

For my offenses

For my redemption

You carried all the blame

Breaking the curse

Of our condition

Perfection took our place


[Chorus]

           Bm  D/F#  G    D
When only love could make a way
        Bm     D/F#  G
You gave your life in a beautiful exchange


[Verse 3]

My burden erased

My life forgiven

There is nothing that could take this love away

And my only desire and sole ambition

Is to love you just the same


[Chorus] 


When only love could make a way

You gave your life in a beautiful exchange

When only love could break these chains

You gave your life in a beautiful exchange


[Bridge]

A            G
  Holy are you God
Bm              D
  Holy is your name
A                        G
  With everything Iâ€™ve got
Bm                                   D
  My heart will sing how I love you
