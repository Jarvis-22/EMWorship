[Verse 1]

       Am G/B C              G
In the valley, oh God You're near
       Am G/B C             F
In the quiet, oh God You're near
       Am G/B C              G
In the shadow, oh God You're near
      Am G/B C                F
At my breaking, oh God You're near


[Chorus 1]

   C   F                   Am G/B
Oh God, You never leave my side
     C   F                            Am G/B
Your love, will stand firm for all my life


[Verse 2]
(same as verse 1)

In my searching, oh God You're near
In my wandering, oh God You're near
When I feel alone, oh God You're near
At my lowest, oh God You're near


[Bridge]

Em         F         Am
Height nor depth nor anything else,
      G
Could pull us apart
       Em        F            Am    G
We are joined as one, by Your blood
Em        F        Am
Hope will rise, as we become more,
     G 
Than conquerors through,
    Em      F          Am    G
The One who loved the world


[Chorus 2]

   Am F                    C     Em
Oh God, You never leave my side
     Am F                             C     Em
Your love, will stand firm for all my life
