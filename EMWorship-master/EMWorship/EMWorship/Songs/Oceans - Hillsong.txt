[Verse 1]
Bm          A/C#                D
You call me out upon the waters
          A                      G
The great unknown where feet may fail
Bm          A/C#              D
And there I find you in the mystery
      A                       G
In oceans deep, my faith will stand

G          D             A
And I will call upon Your name
G           D             A
And keep my eyes above the waves
             G
When oceans rise
             D           A
My soul will rest in Your embrace

For I am Yours and You are mine

Your sovereign hand will be my guide

Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me

You’ve never failed and You won’t start now
