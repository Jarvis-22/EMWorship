[Verse 1]
C
I have lost my appetite
C                      G            Am
And a flood is welling up behind my eyes
      Em
So I eat the tears I cry
C
And if that were not enough
C                          G                 Am
They know just the words to cut and tear and prod
                              Em
When they ask me “Whereʼs your God?”
F             C             G
Why are you downcast, oh my soul?
           Am       G    F
Why so disturbed within me?
F        C              Am                G
I can remember when you showed your face to me

[Chorus]
Am                               C                G
As a deer pants for water, so my soul thirsts for you
        Am                       C                G
And when I survey Your splendor, You so faithfully renew
       F       C
Like a bed of rest
       F       C
for my fainting flesh

[Verse 2]
When Iʼm looking at the ground
Itʼs an inbred feedback loop that drags me down
So itʼs time to lift my brow
And remember better days
When I loved to worship you and learn your ways
Singing sweetest songs of praise

[Bridge]
      F                                  C
Let my sighs give way to songs that sing about your faithfulness
      F                              C
Let my pain reveal your glory as my only real rest
      F               G           Am      C
Let my losses show me all I truly have is you

[Verse 3]
So when Iʼm drowning out at sea
And all your breakers and your waves crash down on me
Iʼll recall your safety scheme
Youʼre the one who made the waves
And your Son went out to suffer in my place
And to show me that Iʼm safe

F          C
Why am I down?
G         Am
Why so disturbed?
F          C
I am satisfied in you
