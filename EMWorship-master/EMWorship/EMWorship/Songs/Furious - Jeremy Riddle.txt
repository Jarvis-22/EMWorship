[Verse 1]

F                    Am
Nothing can tear us from
     F                  Am
The grip of His mighty love
      F      
We’ve only glimpsed, His vast affection
       Am
Heard whispers of, His heart and 

passion
      G
It’s pouring down…


[Chorus]

F                 
His love is deep, His love is wide
And it covers us
C
His love is fierce, His love is strong
It is furious
F
His love is sweet, His love is wild
                              C
And its waking hearts to life


[Verse 2]
(same chords)

The Father loves and sends His son
The Son lays down His life for all
He lavishes His love upon us
He calls us now, His sons and daughters
He’s reaching out…


[Outro]
                           Am
… and its waking hearts to life
                        G
He is waking hearts to life
                        F
He is waking hearts to life
