[Verse]

G                                                       C
I was an orphan, lost at the fall; running away when I’d hear you call, 
G                                C
But Father, you worked your will. 
G                
I had no righteousness of my own 
C
I had no right to draw near your throne, 
G                              C
But Father, you loved me still. 


[Chorus 1]

       D                Em                   C
And in love, before you laid the world’s foundation, 
       D           Em               C
You predestined to adopt me as your own. 
         D               Em             C
You have raised me up so high above my station; 
       D              Em               C
I’m a child of God by grace, and grace alone 


[Verse 2]



You left your home to seek out the lost; 
You knew the great and terrible cost 
But Jesus, your face was set. 
I worked my fingers down to the bone; 
Nothing I did could ever atone, 
Jesus, you paid my debt. 


[Chorus 2]


By your blood I have redemption and salvation. 
Lord you died that I might reap what you have sown, 
And you rose that I might be a new creation. 
I am born again by grace, and grace alone. 


[Bridge]

G
I was darkness all of my life, 
C
I never knew the day from the night, 
D               Em       C
But Spirit, you made me see. 
G
I swore I knew the way on my own; 
C
Head full of rocks, a heart made of stone 
D                Em       C
But Spirit, you moved in me. 


[Chorus 3]

G                                          C
And At your touch my sleeping spirit was awakened; 
Em                                            C
On my darkened heart the light of Christ has shone. 
G                      Am            C
Called into a kingdom that cannot shaken; 
Em                  D                 C
Heaven’s citizen by grace, and grace alone.

          D               Em                C        
So I’ll stand in faith by grace, and grace alone 
         D                 Em                C   
I will run the race by grace, and grace alone 
          D            Em                 C        
I will slay my sin by grace, and grace alone 
          D                Em             C        
I will reach the end by grace, and grace alone
