Capo 4th Fret

[Intro] Em,D,G

[Verse 1]
Em         D                    G
Let love explode and bring the dead to life
Am         G
A love so bold
            Cadd9
To see a revolution somehow.
Em         D                    G
Let love explode and bring the dead to life
Am         G
A love so bold
              Cadd9
To bring a revolution somehow

[Pre-Chorus]
D                      Em
Now I'm lost in your freedom
D                  Cadd9
This world I'll overcome.

[Chorus]
   D
My God is not dead
He's surely alive
    Em
He's living on the inside
Roaring like a lion

[Bridge] G,D,Em,Cadd9

[Verse 2]
Em         D                   G   
Let hope arise and make the darkness hide
Am           G
My faith is dead
          Cadd9
I need a resurrection somehow (x2)

[Pre-Chorus]
D                      Em
Now I'm lost in your freedom
D                  Cadd9
This world I'll overcome.

   D
My God is not dead
He's surely alive
    Em
He's living on the inside
Roaring like a lion

[Bridge]
            G             D
Let Heaven roar and fire fall
                Em
come shake the ground
                  Cadd9
with the sound of revival (x4)

[Chorus]
  D
My God is not dead
He's surely alive
    Em
He's living on the inside
Roaring like a lion
