[Verse 1]

Em             C          G
Water you turned into wine
Em             C          G
opened the eyes of the blind
               Am
there's no one like you
        D
none like you
Em             C          G
Into the darkness you shine
Em             C       G
out of the ashes we rise
                 Am
there`s  no one like you
        D
none like you


[Chorus]
Em
Our God is greater
C
Our God is stronger
G                         D
God you are higher than any other
Em
Our God is Healer
C
Awesome in power
G
Our God
D
Our God
