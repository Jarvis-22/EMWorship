Intro (G C Em D)


      G            D
It’s falling from the clouds
   C                 G
A strange and lovely sound
  Em7            C            D
I hear it in the thunder and rain
      G          D
It’s ringing in the skies
      C             G
Like cannons in the night
    Em7           C        D
The music of the universe plays


          G         C
(singing) You are holy, great and mighty
    Em                    D
The moon and the stars declare who You are
   G             C
I’m so unworthy, but still You love me
   Em                  D                    G (Back into Intro Riff)
Forever my heart will sing of how great You are


G          D
Beautiful and free
     C          G
The song of galaxies
      Em7            C              D
It’s reaching far beyond the Milky Way
     G             D
Lets join in with the sound
   C                G
C’mon let’s sing it loud
       Em7           C        D
As the music of the universe plays


Chorus
