G
Our lives built on tin cans and string
                                                        C
But the cornerstone laid is a wondrous and beautiful thing
              G
Sure in the ground

 G
While the North wind is taking its toll
                                                         C
You have helped me to find my way back and to anchor my soul
              G     
Safe in the sound


Em7
    Oh you know me
C                  G
    Oh and I know you
Em7
    And I know that
C                      G
    We can see this through

 G
I'm brack and baring my bones said if we heard the howling
                         C
I'd run out to face it alone
                G
To meet it half way

 G
But I've still got badges to earn so keep sifting my soul
                                     C
Cause I think that I'm starting to learn
                  G
To love you that way


Em7
    Oh you know me
C                  G
    Oh and I know you
Em7
    And I know that
C                      G
    We can see this through

Bm                               C      Em
       It's true that you could snap my neck
Bm                             C
       I trust you'll save my life instead

       G
Cause our love is a loyalty sworn if we hold to our hope
                                 C
Then I know we can weather the storm
               G
Whatever they say
          Em7
Come what may


Em7
Oh you know me
C                  G
Oh and I know you
Em7
And I know that
C                      G
 We can see this through
