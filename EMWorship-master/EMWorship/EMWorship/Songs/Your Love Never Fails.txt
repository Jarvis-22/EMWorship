[VERSE]
Em         C   
Nothing can separate
G         D
Even if I ran away
Em                C     G   D
Your love never fails

Em            C   
I know I still make mistakes
       G                       D
But You have new mercies for me everyday
Em                C     G   D
Your love never fails


[CHORUS]

C                G                 D
You stay the same through the ages
Am                C
Your love never changes
             G                     D                  Am
There may be pain in the night but joy comes in the morning

C       G             D
And when the oceans rage
        Am               C
I don't have to be afraid
          G                     D
Because I know that You love me
Am
Your love never fails

C   Em   D


[VERSE 2]

Em                        C   
The wind is strong and the water's deep
       G                        D
But I'm not alone here in these open seas
      Em                C     G   D
Cause Your love never fails
Em           C   
The chasm is far too wide
G                             D
I never thought I'd reach the other side
    Em                C     G   D
But Your love never fails


[BRIDGE]

         C            Em                  D
You make  all things  work together for my good.
