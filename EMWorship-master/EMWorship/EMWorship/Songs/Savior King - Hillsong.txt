[Verse 1]

            Am       G      C
And now the weak say I have strength
       Am        C          Am            G        C
By the spirit of power that raised Christ from the dead
            Am         G      C            Dm         Am
And now the poor stand and confess that my portion is Him
        C    G    C
And Iâ€™m more than blessed


[Pre-Chorus]

Am                                    F
Let now our hearts burn with a flame
                     C              G
A fire consuming all for Your Son's holy name
Am                              F
And with the heavens we declare
            Dm    G
You are our king.


[Chorus]

            C
We love You Lord
           Am
We worship You
            G
You are our God
              C
You alone are good


[Verse 2]

             Am            G      C
And now your church shines as the bride
         Am          C            Am      G       C
That You saw in Your heart as You offered up your life
            Am      G        C           Dm            Am
And now the lost be welcomed home by the saved and the redeemed
       C      G       C
Those adopted as your own


[Pre-Chorus]

Am                                    F
Let now our hearts burn with a flame
                     C              G
A fire consuming all for Your Son's holy name
Am                              F
And with the heavens we declare
            Dm    G
You are our king.

You asked your son
         Am
To carry this
          G
The heavy cross
              C
Our weight on sin
           C
I love you lord
          Am
I worship you
               G
Hope which was lost
             C
Now stands renewed

I give my life
         Am
To honor this
            G
The love of Christ
            C
The Saviour King
