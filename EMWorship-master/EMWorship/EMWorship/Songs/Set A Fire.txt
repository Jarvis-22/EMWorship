[Verse]

C              
No place I'd rather be
F
No place I'd rather be
Am
No place I'd rather be
     F
Than here in your love, here in your love


[Chorus]

C                          F
So set a fire down in my soul
                                       Am
That I can't contain, that I can't control
                     F
I want more of you God, 
                     C
I want more of you God
