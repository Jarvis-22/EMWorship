[Verse]

C                                                Fmaj7
There's nothing worth more, that will ever come close
                                        C
No thing can compare, You're our living hope
        Fmaj7
Your Presence
C                                        Fmaj7
I've tasted and seen, of the sweetest of Loves
                                             C
Where my heart becomes free, and my shame is undone
           Fmaj7
In Your Presence


[Chorus]

C
Holy Spirit You are welcome here
     F                             Dm7
Come flood this place and fill the atmosphere
     C
Your Glory God is what our hearts long for
      F                Dm7                      
To be overcome by Your Presence Lord
