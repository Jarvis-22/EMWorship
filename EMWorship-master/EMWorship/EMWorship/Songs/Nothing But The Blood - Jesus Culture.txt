 G              Dsus
What can wash away my sin?
 Em7                     C2
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
 G               Dsus
What can make me whole again?
 Em7                     C2
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

 G                 Dsus
Oh precious is the flow
 Em7          C2
That makes me white as snow
 G       Dsus      
No other fount I know
 Em7                     C2
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
