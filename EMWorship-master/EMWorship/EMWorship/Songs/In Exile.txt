Verse 1:

Am               C
I am in exile, a sojourner
  Am                    C
A citizen of some other place
         Am                          C
All I've seen is just a glimmer in a shadowy mirror
      Am                             C
But I know, one day well see face to face

Am              C x2

Verse 2:

Am              C
I am a nomad, a wanderer
       Am                        C
I have nowhere to lay my head down
           Am                                   C
There's no point in putting roots too deep when I'm moving on
          Am                        C
Not settling for this unsettling town

Chorus:

C        Em             F           Am
My heart is filled with songs of forever
                F                      Am
The city that endures when all is made new
                 F               Am
I know I don't belong here, I'll never
                   F                      Am
Call this place my home, I'm just passing through

Am              C x2

Verse 3:

Am                C
I am a pilgrim, a voyager
       Am                           C
I wont rest until my lips touch the shore
       Am                                 C
Of the land that I've been longing for as long as I've lived
              Am                 C
Where they'll be no penalties anymore

Chorus:

C        Em             F           Am
My heart is filled with songs of forever
                F                      Am
The city that endures when all is made new
                 F               Am
I know I don't belong here, I'll never
                   F                      Am
Call this place my home, I'm just passing through

Outro:

F       Am
Whoa oh oh (repeat)
