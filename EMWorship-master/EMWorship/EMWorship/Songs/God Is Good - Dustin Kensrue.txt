A                 F#m                      C#m
Even when it seems the answer's no
A                     F#m                     E
The promises of God all find their yes
    F#m                           E                   B
In Christ who worked the Father's will below
      F#m                E                           B
That all who run to him would find their rest

And even when it seems he hides his face
And darkness seems to be our only friend
We look to Christ who suffered in our place
That one day all our suffering would end

            A                      C#m
God is good, all of the time
                E                  B
All of the time, God is good
           F#m                 C#m        
God is good, all of the time
           B
God is good 


And even when it seems he pays no mind
We have a guarantee of his great love
In Christ who came and left his crown behind
That one day we would reign with him above

            F#m  E        B   
Lord we believe, but help our unbelief
Lord we believe, but help our hearts to sing

That you are good, all of the time
All of the time, you are good
You are good, all of the time
You are good
(Lord, you are good)
